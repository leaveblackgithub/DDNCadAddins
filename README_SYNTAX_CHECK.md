# DDNCadAddins Project Syntax Check and Fix Tool

## Overview
This tool is used to automatically check and fix common code syntax issues in the DDNCadAddins project. This functionality is integrated into `build.bat` to facilitate syntax checking and fixing during the build process.

## File Description
- `build.bat` - Project build script with integrated syntax checking and auto-fixing
- `analyze_syntax.ps1` - PowerShell script that analyzes build errors and generates a report
- `fix_common_issues.ps1` - PowerShell script that automatically fixes common syntax issues
- `reports/syntax_analysis_report.md` - Generated syntax analysis report

## Usage
1. Run `build.bat` to build the project
2. If syntax errors are found during the build process, the script will automatically run the analysis tool and generate a report
3. The script will ask if you want to run the automatic fix tool
4. Check `reports/syntax_analysis_report.md` for detailed error information

## Supported Syntax Rules
The tool can detect and fix the following common issues:

### StyleCop Rules
- SA1101: Missing 'this.' prefix for class members
- SA1503: Braces should be on a separate line
- SA1000: Keywords should have space before opening parenthesis
- SA1003: Operators should have spaces on both sides

### Code Analysis Rules
- CA1310: String operations should specify StringComparison
- CA2007: Async methods should use ConfigureAwait
- CA1307: String comparisons should use StringComparison.Ordinal
- CA1305: Format strings should specify IFormatProvider

### Compiler Warnings
- CS0618: Using an obsolete method
- CS0612: Type or member is obsolete
- CS0168: Variable declared but never used

## Best Practices
1. Run `build.bat` after every code change to check for syntax issues
2. Review the analysis report to understand the errors in detail
3. Let the tool automatically fix common issues, but fix complex problems manually
4. Rebuild after fixing issues to verify they've been resolved

## Notes
1. The automatic fix feature cannot solve all problems; complex issues still need manual handling
2. The fix script will automatically create code backups; you can restore from the backup directory if needed
3. The `.editorconfig` file can help IDEs automatically apply code style rules
4. It's recommended to recompile the project after fixes to confirm issues are resolved

## Best Practices
1. First run the syntax check to understand the issues in the project
2. Review the generated report to understand the types and distribution of problems
3. Run the automatic fix to solve common issues
4. Use IDE tools (like Visual Studio's code cleanup) to handle complex issues
5. Use `.editorconfig` to ensure future code adheres to project standards

## Future Extensions
1. Consider integrating `.editorconfig` into Visual Studio or other IDEs
2. Integrate syntax checking into CI/CD processes to ensure code quality
3. Perform regular syntax checks to avoid issue accumulation
